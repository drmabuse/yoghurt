!!!AUDIOFILE IS HERE TO FULFILL ITS DESTINY!!!

AudioFile class provides you a universal interface for opening,  editing and saving audio files of 
ANY FORMAT (well, at present only of WAVE files but if you want some other shit, it is open source 
babe -- go write it yourself!).
To get an example on how to write your own program read 'test.cpp'. In short, well you just create
an instance of AudioFile class, apply readAudioFile() to it and do whatever you want with it (even
fuck it). After you've done you should use writeAudioFile() to save the audio in raw WAVE format.

Enjoy your mindfuck with this shit!

Sincerely yours,
drmabuse.
